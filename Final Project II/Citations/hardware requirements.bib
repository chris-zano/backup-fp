This chapter discusses the process to ensure that installation prerequisites are met. It explores the Windows Server 2008 R2 installation process and post installation activities, including activation. It then concludes with an introduction to automating installation and a review of administration basics. Microsoft publishes hardware requirements, also known as system requirements, for every OS it releases. These requirements include the minimum processor speed, memory, and disk space required to install Windows. Prior to installing any operating system (OS), the server hardware should be optimized. Taking this extra step can ensure a smooth installation process and lessen the likelihood of having to troubleshoot installation errors. Before installing Windows, complete the following hardware upgrades: install the latest BIOS update, update any storage controllers, including storage area network (SAN) host bus adapters (HBA), to the latest firmware release, and so on. Individuals and business organizations that either do not purchase the software licenses or purchase fewer licenses than they actually employ often use Microsoft networks OSs. To help counter illegal software piracy, Microsoft introduced product activation in retail editions of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. Microsoft learned that many organizations were not necessarily looking to illegally deploy software, but that they failed to properly manage their license counts or casually reused licenses on multiple computers.}
