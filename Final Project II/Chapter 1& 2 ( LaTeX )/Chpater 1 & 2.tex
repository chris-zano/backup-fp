\section{INTRODUCTION}
\end{center}
\subsection{Background of Study}

E-learning is a learning system based on leveraging the capabilities of
technology in teaching and learning practices. It has been on the rise in the
past few years. Many e-learning platforms have been developed to solve problems
that arose due to the pandemic. According to the Ghana Journal of Higher
Education, the modern landscape of higher education is undergoing a shift
towards digital platforms, allowing for a wider accommodation of students
across a relatively broader geographical area for teaching and learning. Amid
the necessities that arose because of the pandemic, e-learning rose to become a
basic form of education at all teaching levels, which actually led to an
increased accessibility and flexibility and also enabled a broader reach for
students across different locations. However, there is the question about the
sustainability of this e-learning trend post-pandemic, and whether there will
be a return to traditional teaching and learning methods, or that the
development of e-learning platforms will be continued by innovators.\\
\vspace{0.2cm}\\ The emergence of e-learning in the traditional teaching and
learning presents its own sets of opportunities and challenges. Gyamfi and Addo
discuss the limitations of the traditional model, especially in addressing the
modern demands of education.\cite{gyamfi2020stakeholders} This approach has
struggled to accommodate the evolving needs of the modern digital age,
particularly in providing access to education, especially in remote regions,
contributing to a gap in effective online learning as compared to traditional
learning. They emphasize the importance of acknowledging the limitations of
traditional teaching methods and embracing innovative approaches to education,
such as e-learning. One such approach would be in the development of a
comprehensive, integrated learning platform that caters to the modern demands
of education:- personalize the learning experience for each student, catering
to their individual strengths and weaknesses; incorporate opportunities for
students to develop critical thinking skills through interactive activities,
simulations and project based learning;developing of digital literacy skills as
well as fostering collaboration and communication among students and tutors.\\
\vspace{0.2cm}\\ There are many such e-learning systems in the world we live in
today. Such platforms like Udemy, ALX SE, Edureka, Scrimba, Harvard Extension,
among others, have played a vital role in facilitating access to educational
resources and opportunities (educational democratization), however, these
platforms often focus on specific niches or cater to a more individual learner
journey.

Kim, Lee \& Yoon \cite{kim2023better}came up with a model to guide the design
and development of an e-learning platform so it would be successful. They
suggest five factors that contribute to the success of an e-learning
platform.These are;
\begin{enumerate}
      \item \text{system quality - this is the functionality, reliability and usability of the e-learning platform}
      \item lecture content - referring to the quality, relevance and accessibility of
            learning materials on the platform.\\
      \item teaching quality - which is the effectiveness on the lecturer's part in
            delivering educational content.\\
      \item online interaction - refers to the level of engagement and interaction among
            students, instructors and course materials\\
      \item achievements - which are the tangible outcomes attained by students and
            instructors in relation to predefined learning objectives and performance
            standards that have been set.\\
\end{enumerate}
Despite the comprehensive features offered by platforms like Moodle, which is widely recognized for its flexibility, customization, and robust pedagogical support, it lacks integrated video conferencing capabilities. This limitation is critical for institutions like Ghana Communication Technology University (GCTU), where geographical distance and high costs associated with third-party solutions pose significant challenges. By focusing on these core principles, we aim to create an integrated teaching and learning environment using GCTU as a case study. The internet is the perfect tool for learning, as it offers flexibility and expediency to learners at the same time offering endless opportunities for innovative teaching.

\subsection{Problem Statement}
The goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive, integrated e-learning
platform tailored to the specific needs of universities in Africa, particularly
Ghana Communication Technology University (GCTU). While Moodle, a widely-used
Learning Management System (LMS), offers numerous benefits, it lacks built-in
video conferencing capabilities, which are essential for effective remote
learning. This project aims to address the limitations of current solutions,
enhance accessibility, and reduce costs for GCTU.\\ \vspace{0.2cm}\\ E Learning
provides a very promising solution to this challenges by reducing the reliance
on physical classrooms, thereby enhancing access to education for students in
remote areas and also expand the universities global reach. It will solve the
problem of accommodation constraints by offering courses online, eliminating
the need for everybody to come to campus at once. Also students in remote areas
can access the quality education by using the e-learning platform, regardless
of their location. This bridges the geographical gap and allows for fair and
equal access to quality education. Finally, the university would be able to
extend its wings and offer access to education to students worldwide. Harvard
University’s extension school, for instance, offers a variety of online courses
and even full degree programs to learners worldwide. This move by Harvard,
shows that they recognized the limitations of traditional educational models in
meeting the demands. This would increase the university’s international
recognition and would contribute in creating a global learning community,
whereby students from different countries worldwide can collaborate and learn
together.\\

\subsubsection{Limited Accommodation and Accessibility Challenges at GCTU}
This university faces a significant challenge in providing adequate on-campus
housing for its student population and the ones available around campus are
costly. This results in a large portion of the students body residing far from
campus, often at least 10 kilometers away. This geographical distance creates a
barrier to traditional in-person learning, giving that lectures start at 8 am,
it forces students to make long and potentially expensive and exhausting daily
commutes to attend lectures.\\

\subsubsection{The High Cost of Existing Solutions}
While third-party video conferencing platforms like Zoom or TeamViewer provide
an option for remote learning, the ongoing costs associated with these services
could result in a substantial financial challenge for GCTU. For a technical
institution like GCTU, which encourages innovation and seeks to capitalize on
its own experience, this is particularly concerning. Relying on costly external
solutions is not sustainable in the long term.\\

\subsubsection{The Limitations of Moodle}
Moodle LMS \cite{moodle2024review}, is widely recognized for its flexibility,
customization, and robust features that support various pedagogical approaches.
It excels in course management, user management, communication tools,
assessment and grading, resource management, among other strengths. Despite
these strengths, Moodle lacks a built-in video conferencing feature, which is
crucial for facilitating real-time interaction and collaboration between
instructors and students.\\

\subsubsection{The Need for a Custom, Cost-Effective E-Learning Platform}
To address these challenges, GCTU requires a bespoke e-learning platform that
combines the benefits of Moodle with integrated video conferencing
capabilities. This platform must prioritize the following features:\\

\begin{itemize}
      \item i.Video Conferencing: This feature would aim to facilitate real-time
            interaction and collaboration between instructors and students, regardless of
            location, to replicate the traditional classroom experience.\\
      \item Cost-Effectiveness: Eliminating ongoing licensing fees for external video
            conferencing platforms to save valuable resources and ensure long-term
            financial sustainability.\\
      \item Data Privacy and Security: Ensuring full control over student and staff data
            with enhanced security measures tailored to the institution's requirements.\\
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Research Aim and Objectives}
\subsubsection{Research Aim}
The main objective is to develop a web application that facilitates a
high-quality, remote learning experience for students. This platform will
eliminate the need for physical campus attendance by providing a comprehensive
suite of educational tools, including:\\

\begin{itemize}
      \item Video conferencing: To enable real-time interaction between instructors and
            students.\\
      \item Centralized repository: To offer a secure and organized location for accessing
            learning materials such as lectures recordings, notes, assignments.\\
      \item Assessment tools: Allows instructors to evaluate student comprehension through
            various methods such as quizzes, exams, projects.\\
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Specific Objectives}
\textbf{Functional Requirements:}
\begin{itemize}
      \item Implement diverse assessment tools (e.g., quizzes, essays, peer reviews)\\
      \item Develop a content management system (CMS) for lecturers\\
      \item Design and develop admin, lecturer, and student interfaces\\
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Non-Functional Requirements:}
\begin{itemize}
      \item Develop a user-friendly interface\\
      \item Ensure robust security measures for data protection\\
      \item Optimize performance for seamless user experience\\
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Significance of study}
The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the shift towards digital learning, as
highlighted by research conducted by Jakhar et al. (2020). Even though many
schools are trying to transition back to face-to-face or in-person teaching and
learning, the need for having a flexible and accessible learning solution still
remains a priority. In a similar research conducted by the students of GCTU
last year (2023), Adagobo et al,\cite{emmanuel2022design}, proposed that
successfully developing a platform that serves in the context of e-learning
would serve the university in improving learning procedures on campus.
Implementing a hybrid approach to learning, combining the positives of
asynchronous learning and synchronous learning would greatly improve teaching
and learning in the school.\cite{islam2015challenges} Students residing far
from campus or juggling work and studies can access course materials and
complete assignments on time, and since some students grasps concepts quickly,
while others benefit from revisiting materials and practicing at their own
pace, the features incorporated on this platform would allow them to focus on
understanding before moving on. Some students also prefer visual learning
through recordings, while others benefit from interactive activities. This
hybrid approach would cater to these different learning styles.\\

\subsection{Scope and Limitation}
\subsubsection{The scope of this research}
This research will focus on developing a comprehensive online learning module
as a pilot program for the Computer Engineering and Telecommunications
Engineering Program within the Faculty of Engineering at Ghana Communication
Technology University. The platform will be designed with scalability in mind
to accommodate future integration with other faculties in subsequent
iterations.\\

\subsubsection{The limitations of this research}
\begin{enumerate}
      \item The initial development phase will prioritize core functionalities like video
            conferencing, content delivery, and assessment tools.
      \item The pilot program will be implemented with courses offered by the Faculty of
            Engineering. Scaling the platform university-wide will require additional
            planning and resource allocation to accommodate the needs of other faculties.
      \item External factors such as unreliable internet connectivity and power supply in
            some regions of Ghana could potentially impact the platform's effectiveness.
            Future research directions could explore incorporating offline functionalities
            or developing partnerships with internet service providers to address these
            challenges.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Brief Methodology}
\subsubsection{ Design Concept}
This project will implement an Agile development approach using the Scrum
framework. Scrum places a strong emphasis on user feedback, iterative
development, and continuous improvement.\\

\begin{enumerate}
      \item Product Backlog: A comprehensive list of functionalities will be created,
            prioritizing features based on user needs and project goals.\\
      \item Sprints: Development will occur in short, time-boxed sprints (2-week
            iterations) where a set of features is developed, tested, and deployed.\\
      \item User Feedback: After each sprint, user feedback will be incorporated to refine
            the platform and prioritize features for future iterations.\\
\end{enumerate}

This approach allows for flexibility and adaptation as the project progresses,
ensuring the final platform effectively meets the needs of students,
instructors, and administrators.\\

\section{LITERATURE REVIEW}
\end{center}
\subsection{Overview}
This chapter conducts a comprehensive review of the existing literature
relevant to the field of study. It lays the foundation for the proposed project
by by providing a detail analysis of each of the projects parts. This chapter
explores the theoretical frameworks and methodological approaches used in
earlier studies. It offers an evaluation of of relevant projects pertaining to
WebRTC (Web Real Time Communication), SSR (Server Side Rendering), Scalable
Database management Systems and the use of ODM (Object Data Modelling)
libraries, Containerization, System architecture design to avoid SPOF (Single
Point of Failure) as well as Web Sockets. Reviews in this chapter are drawn
from online resources and journal publications.\\

\subsection{Current Issues of Concern}
The university system in Ghana is having a hard time keeping up with the
increasing number of students enrolled. The restricted housing options on and
around campus leads to bottlenecks, and students in remote locations frequently
do not have access to high-quality educational programs. Universities also find
it difficult to have a solid worldwide reputation and reach outside of Ghana.
These problems undermine both the overall influence of Ghanaian institutions
and educational equity. Furthermore, the increasing demand for flexible and
accessible learning options adds another layer of complexity. Students are
looking for educational options that work with their hectic schedules and
geographic constraints. This increasing demand for flexibility may not be met
by traditional classroom environments.\\

\subsection{Definition of Related Areas}
This section reviews detailed definitions that are closely related to the
project topic and scope, aiming to make things clearer and further
understanding of the project.\\

\subsubsection{WebRTC (Web Real Time Communication)}
WebRTC, which stands for Web Real-Time Communication, empowers peer-to-peer
associations without the require for third-party servers.Information sharing
over WebRTC is straightforward, supported by WebRTC APIs, and accessible at
many stages thanks to its simplicity. At first, servers are required for
clients to set up associations. After the initial setup, clients can talk
directly to each other, without the server involved.When a client sends data to
the signaling server, the server transfers this data to the other client. After
accepting this information, the client stores it locally. In this way, this
client sends its claim information to the server, which transfers it to the
other client. This trade guarantees both clients are mindful of each other,
encouraging an association foundation. Signaling servers, utilized for this
information trade, are standard servers with the sole reason of encouraging
client information trade.\cite{emmanuel2022design} The method of exchanging
information from one client to another in WebRTC is called signaling. In WebRTC
session establishment, the initial step is offer generation. A client
initiating communication creates an offer, typically a JavaScript object
encapsulating Session Description Protocol (SDP) data. The Session Description
Protocol (SDP) embedded within the offer specifies media capabilities, such as
video and audio codecs supported. The client sends this offer to the signaling
server, which forwards it to the other client. Upon receiving the offer, the
other client stores it locally and constructs an answer containing its own SDP
information. This answer, also transmitted via the signaling server, details
the recipient's media capabilities. While both parties now possess a mutual
understanding of each other's media offerings, an additional exchange of data,
termed ICE (Interactivity Connection Establishment) candidates, is necessary to
establish the peer-to-peer connection. Clients give URLs of these servers to
the WebRTC API to get ICE candidates. As the client makes an offer, ICE
candidates are recovered from the servers. These candidates are at that point
sent to the other client by means of the signaling server. The same handle
happens when creating answers. Once both clients have each other's SDP
information and ICE candidates, they can build up a coordinate peer-to-peer
association. Information transmission through WebRTC APIs from that point
happens straightforward between the clients, empowering efficient and secure
real-time communication.\\

\subsubsection{Web Sockets}
Web Sockets allow for two way communication, between a client like a web
browser and a server through a persistent, full-duplex connection. Unlike HTTP
requests where the client typically initiates communication and the connection
closes after each response, Web Sockets remain open, allowing both the client
and server to exchange messages at any time. This back and forth communication
is ideal for applications requiring low latency real time updates, such as chat
platforms, online games or collaborative editing tools. By using a handshake
process HTTP upgrade request and Web Socket Handshake to establish connections,
Web Sockets can efficiently receive data in both directions without the need
for repeated setup. This efficiency makes Web Sockets more effective for real
time communication compared to methods like polling or long polling. In summary
Web Sockets offer a solution, for creating web applications that demand
immediate responsiveness and minimal delays.\\

\subsubsection{Server Side Rendering}
Server-side rendering (SSR) is a procedure that renders a web page on the
server instead of within the browser. When a website is rendered on the server,
a completely rendered page is sent to the client and the client's JavaScript
bundle locks in and empowers the Single Page Application system to function.
Server side rendering (SSR) is a method employed in web development where the
server dynamically creates the HTML content of a web-page and sends it to the
clients browser. This differs from client side rendering, where the browser
uses JavaScript to generate the HTML content after receiving HTML from the
server.In SSR, when a user asks for a web page, the server handles the request,
collects the data from a database or external APIs, and then generates the HTML
content incorporating this data. The entire HTML page is then transmitted to
the client's browser for display without any processing. This approach can lead
to quicker initial page loading times. Improved search engine optimization
(SEO) since search engines can easily scan and index the HTML content. SSR is
frequently utilized in web applications developed with server side technologies
like Node.js, Django, Ruby on Rails and PHP. It proves advantageous for
websites with content or dynamically generated content where SEO and
performance play vital roles. Nonetheless implementing SSR may add complexity
to development and up keep efforts as it necessitates handling of server side
and client side logic to ensure consistency and optimal performance, across
platforms and devices.\\

\subsubsection{Success of  e-learning  platforms}
The rise of online learning platforms can be explained by several key factors.
First, their on-demand access model grants learners anytime, anywhere learning,
enabling them to progress at their own pace. Second, eLearning platforms offer
a varied content library, catering to various learning preferences through
multimedia elements like quizzes, interactive videos, and simulations. These
elements promote increased learner engagement and improve knowledge retention.
Finally, the inherent scalability and adaptability of eLearning platforms allow
them to effectively serve a wide range of learners with diverse learning needs.
Research conduction by S.Kim et al(2015)\cite{kim2023better} suggests that five
core principles significantly contribute to the success of an eLearning
platform:\\

\begin{enumerate}
      \item System Quality: This encompasses the platform's technical functionality,
            reliability, and user-friendliness. Here, factors like intuitive interface
            design, responsiveness, and seamless content delivery are crucial.\\
      \item Content Quality: This refers to the quality, relevance, and accessibility of
            learning materials hosted on the platform. Content should be well-organized,
            current, and aligned with established learning objectives.\\
      \item Instructional Design: This focuses on the effectiveness of the instructional
            methods employed in delivering the learning content. This includes factors like
            clear learning objectives, well-structured content delivery, and the use of
            appropriate pedagogical approaches.\\
      \item Online Interaction: This emphasizes the level of engagement and interaction
            within the platform. This includes fostering communication and collaboration
            among learners, instructors, and the learning materials themselves through
            discussion forums, group activities, and interactive assessments.\\
      \item Learning Outcomes Assessment: This refers to the process of measuring and
            evaluating the knowledge and skills acquired by learners against predefined
            learning objectives and performance standards. Effective assessment strategies
            should be integrated within the platform to track learner progress and provide
            feedback for continuous improvement.\\

            By focusing on these core principles, eLearning platforms can create an
            integrated and learner-centric teaching and learning environment.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Scalable No-SQL Database Management Systems}
MongoDB stands out as a liked No-SQL database recognized for its ability to
scale effectively. Its distributed architecture is the key, to this scalability
allowing it to manage data volumes and heavy traffic loads efficiently. MongoDB
utilizes sharing to distribute data among servers facilitating scaling. This
implies that as data and traffic increase you can expand the number of servers
in the MongoDB cluster to accommodate the growing demand. The adaptability of
MongoDB schema also plays a role in its scalability. Unlike databases MongoDB
does not mandate a predefined schema making it simple to introduce new fields
or modify existing ones without any downtime. This adaptability proves
beneficial in environments where requirements are subject to frequent changes.
Apart from scaling MongoDB also supports scaling by enabling you to enhance
individual server resources (such as CPU and RAM) within the cluster to manage
higher workloads. The combination of vertical scaling capabilities makes
MongoDB a scalable database solution suitable for various applications ranging
from small startups, to large enterprises.\\

\subsubsection{Containerization with Docker }
Docker, an example of containerization transforms the landscape of software
development and deployment by packaging applications and their requirements,
into self contained units known as containers. These containers operate
reliably across settings spanning from development, to production guaranteeing
behavior of applications regardless of their deployment location.
Containerization offers application segregation, flexibility and optimized
resource usage simplifying the development and deployment workflow while
enhancing resource efficiency compared to machines.\\

\subsubsection{System Architecture Design avoiding Single Point of Failure}
A critical aspect of system architecture design is the elimination or
mitigation of Single Points of Failure (SPOFs). An SPOF is a single component
whose failure can cause the entire system to become inoperable. It's really
important to make sure that a our system doesn't rely on one part that could
cause the whole thing to fail. When a single point of failure occurs it means
that if one component breaks the entire system will stop working. To prevent
this, methods like having backups and being able to handle faults are used to
keep the system running even if something goes wrong with one or more parts.
This is particularly crucial, in systems where any downtime could lead to
losses or affect how users interact with it. Ultimately avoiding points of
failure helps boost the reliability, availability and resilience of a system.\\

\section{METHODOLOGY}
\end{center}
\subsection{Overview}
This project is intended to use the Agile Software Development Methdology with
Scrum as the chosen framework. Agile emphasizes flexibility, iterative
development, as well as colaboration, making it ideal for projects that need to
adapt to changing requirements and foster continuous improvement. The Scrum
framework, a subset of Agile, is employed to structure the project’s
development process into a series of iterative cycles called Sprints. Each
Sprint includes stages of planning, development, testing and review. This
iterative process allows the team to deliver increments of the product
frequently, gather feednack, and adjust the course of development as needed.
The Agile approach with Scrum is particularly beneficial for projects where
requirements may evolve over time or where iterative feedback is crucial. Agile
methodologies like scrum are recommended for projects that require flexibility,
adaptability and continuous deleivery of functional increments.
\cite{schwaber2020scrum}\\

\subsection{Product Backlog Creation}
The Product Backlog is a crucial artifact in Scrum, representing a dynamic list
of work that needs to be done on the project. It includes everything from new
features and enhancements to bug fixes and technical debt. The management of
the backlog, involves prioritizing items based on their value to the project
and their alignment with the overall project goals. This prioritization is
essential for ensuring that the team is always working on the most important
tasks first. As the project evolves, so does the backlog, with items being
added, removed, or re-prioritized based on feedback and changing requirements.
\cite{schwaber2020scrum} \\ The product backlog for the e-learning platform
project is structured around a set of prioritized features and functionalities
designed to advance the research objectives of enhancing user engagement and
improving learning outcomes. Central to this backlog is the development of a
responsive user interface capable of adapting to a wide range of devices,
thereby ensuring accessibility and usability across different platforms. The
project also emphasizes the implementation of a content management system,
which is crucial for facilitating the seamless creation and management of
courses. Additionally, the integration of interactive components, such as a
video conferencing feature, is prioritized to actively engage students in the
learning process. Beyond these core functionalities, the backlog includes the
development of a secure user authentication system, which is essential for
protecting user data and maintaining the integrity of the platform. The
incorporation of real-time analytics is another key feature, enabling the
tracking of student progress and providing valuable insights that can be used
to tailor educational experiences. Furthermore, the support for multimedia
content is recognized as a critical element in enhancing the overall learning
experience, allowing for a richer and more varied educational environment. In
the figure below, we see how our product backlog is structured. This initial
list of items are at the “Epic Level” which means they are too big and vague
for us to be able to structure them based on technical infrastructure and other
dependencies. \\

\begin{figure}[H]
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{figures/productbacklog.png}
      \caption{Product Backlog (Solomon \& Avadzi, 2024)}
\end{figure}

In the development of our Learning Management System (LMS), several key
features and functionalities are prioritized to enhance user experience and
system efficiency, which have made it into the product backlog. For User
Registration and Authentication, users need the capability to register for
accounts and log in securely to access their dashboards, while administrators
require tools to manage user roles and permissions to control access across the
LMS. In Course Management, administrators must be able to create, edit, and
delete courses, assign lecturers, and manage course schedules, while
instructors need to manage their assigned courses and students should be able
to register and enroll in courses to engage in the learning process. The
integration of WebRTC Video Conferencing is crucial, enabling instructors to
schedule and conduct live sessions, students to participate in these sessions,
and all users to share screens and record sessions for later access. The Chat
and Messaging system facilitates real-time communication, allowing students to
collaborate and instructors to send announcements. For Assignment Submission
and Grading, students need to submit their work online and instructors must
review and grade these submissions. The Notification System ensures users stay
informed about video sessions, deadlines, and announcements, with
administrators configuring settings to manage notification overload. System
Scalability and Performance are vital, requiring the ability to handle high
volumes of concurrent video sessions and optimize streaming quality based on
network conditions. Security and Privacy measures include implementing
encryption for video streams and enforcing data privacy policies. Lastly,
Mobile Access must be optimized to ensure that users can participate in courses
and video conferencing from various devices, with developers ensuring the LMS
is responsive and consistent across different screen sizes.\\

\subsection{Sprint Planning}
Sprint Planning is the event that kicks off each Sprint, where we selects items
from the top of the Product Backlog to work on during the upcoming Sprint. The
goal is to determine what can be delivered in the Sprint and how we will
accomplish that work. The outcome of Sprint Planning is a Sprint Goal, a clear
objective that the team commits to achieving, and a Sprint Backlog, which
includes the tasks required to meet that goal. This structured planning process
helps to ensure that the team is focused and aligned on what needs to be
accomplished within the Sprint
timeframe.\cite{beck2001agile}\cite{beedle2001agile}\cite{schwaber2020scrum}\\

In our upcoming sprint, we will focus on several crucial items from the product
backlog to drive our LMS project's progress. Our primary objective is to
enhance user registration and authentication processes, ensuring secure login
and comprehensive management of user roles and permissions by administrators.
We will also prioritize the development of robust course management features,
enabling administrators to create and manage courses, assign lecturers, and
establish schedules, while facilitating student registration and enrollment.
Integrating WebRTC video conferencing is essential, allowing instructors to
schedule and conduct live sessions, with features for screen sharing and
session recording. Additionally, we will implement chat and messaging
capabilities to support real-time communication and announcements. The sprint
will address assignment submission and grading workflows, streamline
notifications for users, and configure settings to prevent notification
overload. We will also focus on ensuring system scalability and optimizing
performance to handle concurrent video sessions and varying network conditions.
Security measures will include encryption for video streams and adherence to
data privacy policies. Finally, we will enhance mobile access to ensure a
consistent and responsive user experience across devices.\\

\begin{figure}[H]
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{figures/sprint-planning.png}
      \caption{Sprint Planning (Solomon \& Avadzi, 2024)}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Sprint Exxecution}
During Sprint Execution, the development team works on the tasks identified in
the Sprint Backlog to achieve the Sprint Goal. This phase is characterized by
intense collaboration among team members, who frequently communicate to ensure
progress is on track and to quickly address any issues that
arise.\cite{beck2001agile}\\ In this sprint execution phase, our focus will be
on systematically addressing the prioritized tasks from the product backlog to
ensure efficient delivery of key features. We will start by implementing and
testing enhancements to the user registration and authentication processes,
focusing on secure login and comprehensive management of user roles by
administrators. Next, we will develop and refine course management
functionalities, including the creation, editing, and scheduling of courses,
and enabling student enrollment. Concurrently, we will integrate WebRTC video
conferencing, enabling instructors to schedule live sessions, share screens,
and record sessions, while ensuring the feature supports smooth real-time
interaction for students. The chat and messaging system will be developed to
facilitate effective communication and announcements. We will also work on the
assignment submission and grading features to streamline the process for both
students and instructors. The notification system will be configured to provide

      \item WebCam
      \item Microphone
      \item Router
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Software Requirements}\\
The various software applications used in the design and implementation of the project includes:\\
\begin{enumerate}
      \item Operating System\\ The operating system provides the needed environment for
            software development and execution. For our project, we used Windows 11 Home.
            This is because it is compatible with a wide selection of development tools and
            applications, it offers enhanced performance and stability, the UI provides an
            intuitive and efficient workspace, which can improve productivity during
            development and testing phases. And because the scope of our project does not
            require enterprise-level features, Windows 11 Home offers a cost-effective
            solution without compromising on the essential functionalities needed for
            development.

      \item Web Browser\\ A web browser is a software application used to access
            information on the World Wide Web \cite{byjus2024}. For our project, Google
            Chrome was selected for its performance, developer tools, compatibility, and
            strong security features \cite{emmanuel2022design}, all of which contribute to
            a more efficient and effective development process.\\
      \item Text Editor\\ The text editor of choice is the Microsoft Visual Studio Code (VS
            Code). VS Code supports a wide range of programming languages and frameworks,
            making it suitable for diverse development tasks. It also has a rich ecosystem
            of extensions and plugins that enhance functionality, including support for

            terminal, it is cross-platform and has a user-friendly interface. \\

      \item MongoDB\\ MongoDB was chosen as our Database Management System (DBMS) for the
            project because of its flexibility and scalability. It is a NoSQL database that
            stores data in JSON-like format, allowing for dynamic schema design as well as
            the handling of unstructured or semi-structured data \cite{mongodb}. It is also
            well integrated in our programming language of choice, JavaScript.\\

      \item MongoDB Compass\\ MongoDB compass is a powerful Graphical user interfae ( GUI )
            for querying, aggregating and analysing your mongodb data in a visual
            environment. It allows users to connect to MongoDB deployment hosted on a
            remote server or on the users’ local machine. MongoDB compass provides
            real-time data and performance statistic visualisations, which allows us to
            better in understanding database behaviour and how to ways for query
            optimisation \cite{mongodb_compass}.\\

            \cite{w3schools2024}.\\

      \item WebRTC \& PeerJS\\ PeerJS is used to simplify the project's implementation of
            peer-to-peer communication. PeerJS provides an easy-to-use API that
            encapsulates the difficulties of setting up WebRTC peer connections, allowing
            clients to exchange real-time audio, video, and data. It manages the signalling
            process, peer finding, and connection management, allowing developers to
            concentrate on application logic rather than underlying infrastructure.
            PeerJS's capabilities are critical for developing real-time communication
            features like video chat and file sharing without having to deal with the
            intricacies of WebRTC protocols \cite{webrtc2024} \cite{peerjs2024}.\\

                  \caption{WebRTC architecture  (W3C WG, 2022)}
            \end{figure}

      \item Embedded JavaScript (EJS)\\ EJS (Embedded JavaScript) is used to render HTML
            templates on the server side of and we will use this as our templating engine
            for rendering dynamic pages. EJS allows us to embed JavaScript code directly
            into HTML pages, making it easier to generate dynamic content based on
            server-side data. This templating engine supports template inheritance and
            partials, which make it easier to create reusable and maintainable HTML
            components. EJS works smoothly with Node.js applications, giving us an
            efficient way to render views and manage dynamic
            content\cite{geeksforgeeks2024ejs}.\\

      \item Cascading Style Sheets\\ CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to specify the
            visual appearance and layout of the project's web pages. CSS separates content
            from design, allowing developers to apply consistent styling across various
            pages and components. CSS allows developers to customise the look and feel of
            their applications, including colour schemes, typography, spacing, and
            responsive design\cite{w3schools2024css}.\\

\subsubsection{Design and Implementation}
The system architecture diagram provides a comprehensive overview of the LMS's
core components and their interactions, serving as a high-level abstraction to
facilitate understanding of the system's overall structure. At its core, the
diagram illustrates the main elements of the system: the user interface,
application server, WebRTC server, and database, detailing how these components
are interconnected and communicate with each other. The user interface
represents the front-end layer, where users interact with the system. It
includes all the elements that users see and interact with, such as dashboards,
course management tools, and video conferencing interfaces. This layer ensures
a seamless user experience and interfaces with the application server to handle
user requests and present data. The application server functions as the central
processing unit of the system. It manages business logic, handles user
requests, and facilitates communication between the user interface and the
database. It processes authentication, authorization, course management,
assignment submissions, and other critical operations, ensuring that the system
functions smoothly and efficiently. The WebRTC server is integral for real-time
communication, enabling live video sessions, screen sharing, and recording
functionalities. It supports the interactive aspects of the LMS, allowing
instructors and students to engage in real-time video conferencing and
collaborate effectively. The database component stores all persistent data,
including user information, course details, assignment submissions, and chat
messages. It interacts with the application server to retrieve and store data
as needed, ensuring data integrity and accessibility.\\

      \caption{System Architecture (Solomon \& Avadzi, 2024)}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{User Registration and Login}
The process begins when a user accesses the registration or login page of the
platform. The login process is straightforward. Users must input their user id
(student id for students, admin id for administrators and lecturer id for
lecturers ) and password. The system then checks these credentials against the
database to authenticate the user. If the details match, the user is redirected
to their dashboard, where they can access various features of the platform. In
the case of an authentication failure, an error message is displayed, prompting
the user to retry or recover their password.\\
\begin{figure}[H]
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{figures/login flowchart.drawio.png}
      \caption{User Login Flow Chart (Solomon \& Avadzi, 2024)}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Video Conferencing Flow Chart}
Upon the initiation of a session, a participant’s identification and course
details are validated. This is facilitated through a structured URL pattern
that determines the user type (either lecturer or student) and redirects the
user to the appropriate meeting room. The participant's credentials and course
information are stored temporarily in the session storage to ensure continuity
across the session.Once the user accesses the meeting room, the system
retrieves the course and user information to ensure proper authentication and
authorization. Participants' data is then used to set up the communication
environment, where the information about the participants, such as user IDs and
their roles (e.g., lecturer or student), is crucial for managing permissions
and interactions during the session. The system establishes peer-to-peer
connections between participants using the WebRTC framework. This involves
setting up peer connections, exchanging session descriptions (SDP), and
handling ICE (Interactive Connectivity Establishment) candidates, which are
essential for establishing the media streams over varying network conditions.
The negotiation process, initiated either by the host or other participants,
involves creating and setting session descriptions, which detail the media
formats and parameters supported by each peer. \\
\begin{figure}[H]
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{figures/create-offer.png}
      \caption{JavaScript code to establishing connection (Solomon \& Avadzi, 2024)}
\end{figure}
This ensures compatibility and seamless media exchange. Participants' media streams, whether video or audio, are then captured and transmitted across these peer connections. The system ensures that each participant's media is rendered on the interfaces of other participants, allowing for real-time interaction. The handling of media streams is dynamic, enabling participants to toggle between different media sources, such as sharing their screens or switching between audio and video streams. This is particularly useful in a classroom setting, where a lecturer might need to present material via screen sharing.\\
Throughout the session, the system monitors the connection state and signaling state of each peer connection, ensuring that any disruptions, such as disconnections or failures, are managed promptly. The interface dynamically adjusts to reflect the current state of the connections, ensuring that participants are kept informed of any issues, such as a peer leaving the session. Additionally, the platform provides functionality for managing the session lifecycle, including the ability for the host (typically the lecturer) to terminate the session for all participants. This action is accompanied by an update of the course meeting information, which ensures that the session details are accurately recorded and that participants are appropriately redirected once the session ends.\\

The level of detail provided in Level 1 further clarifies the internal workings of the RTC API and Signaling Server, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the video conferencing feature's operation.\\

\subsubsection{Entity Relationship Overview for the Video Conferencing feature}
The Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) illustrates the data structure of the video conferencing feature within the e-learning platform. It showcases the various entities involved, their attributes, and the relationships between them. This ERD is pivotal for understanding how the system manages courses, submissions, and real-time communication (RTC) sessions.\\

\begin{figure}[H]
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{figures/entity-relationship diagram.drawio.png}
      \caption{Entity Relationship Diagram for the Video Conferencing (Solomon \& Avadzi, 2024)}
\end{figure}
The Admin Entity is the administrative core of the system, uniquely identified by the adminid attribute. It maintains references to lecturers, students, and courses through foreign keys, ensuring streamlined management of these entities. The Lecturer Entity, identified by lecturerid, includes arrays for assigned Courses and submissions, reflecting the courses they manage and the submissions they oversee. Similarly, the Student Entity, identified by studentid, contains arrays for courses and a foreign key for classId, linking students to their classes and courses. The Course Entity, with courseId as its primary key, holds vital information about each course, including a unique course code and a reference to the associated class. The Class Entity aggregates courses through an array, highlighting the collective structure of classes within the platform. The RTC Entity, identified by roomid, is crucial for real-time communication, linking each RTC session to specific classes and courses, thereby facilitating seamless virtual interactions. The Course Entity, with courseId as its primary key, holds vital information about each course, including a unique course code and a reference to the associated class. The Class Entity aggregates courses through an array, highlighting the collective structure of classes within the platform.  The RTC Entity, identified by roomid, is crucial for real-time communication, linking each RTC session to specific classes and courses, thereby facilitating seamless virtual interactions.\\

\subsubsection{Course Management and Submission Management}
Upon successful login, students and lecturers access the course management area, which provides a tailored list of courses based on the user’s level, program, and faculty. For students, the registration process involves using system-generated registration codes to enroll in courses. Once registered, the courses are added to the student's courses , effectively integrating the student into the course structure. Lecturers, on the other hand, are tasked with managing their assigned courses. This involves adding lessons and materials to course chapters and initiating live class sessions, thus centralizing course material management.

The submission management system is meticulously designed to streamline the creation and handling of assignments. Lecturers initiate this process by entering essential details such as the course code, title, instructions, and timelines. The system organizes these details into structured objects and links them to the appropriate course using the course code. If no existing submission record is found, a new entry is created in the Submissions collection. For existing records, the system employs the \$addToSet operator to append new submissions, ensuring no duplication. Students interact with this system to access and submit assignments. Upon submission, the system associates the uploaded files with the student’s record in the student-submissions field of the Submissions collection. This organized storage mechanism ensures easy retrieval and review. Post-submission, lecturers can review and grade the work, with the system updating each entry's status to indicate whether it has been graded. Additional functionalities, such as bulk download of submissions and robust error handling, enhance the platform’s utility, ensuring smooth interactions and efficient data management.\\
The ERD and the detailed workflows of course management and submission management provide a comprehensive blueprint of the e-learning platform’s data interactions. This structured approach ensures efficient management of academic activities, fostering seamless communication and collaboration between lecturers and students. The robust design facilitates effective course management, organized submission handling, and real-time communication, thereby enhancing the overall educational experience.\\

\subsubsection{Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN)}
STUN, an IETF protocol, supports real-time communication such as phone, video, and messaging over IP networks. It provides a method to establish connections with users behind a Network Address Translation (NAT) firewall, which conceals their IP addresses within the local network (LAN). The process begins with the initiating party sending a request to the STUN server, which records the device's IP address (such as for video). Subsequently, using protocols like WebRTC or ICE, a peer-to-peer connection is established. Unlike application layer gateways (ALGs) that also enable two-way communication through NATs, STUN does not necessitate any router configuration\cite{emmanuel2022design}.\\

\subsection{Sprint Review and Retrospective}
The Sprint Review, held at the end of each Sprint, serves as a critical checkpoint to inspect the work completed and gather feedback from users. During this meeting, the development team demonstrates the completed work to the users, highlighting the deliverables achieved during the Sprint. The discussion focuses on comparing what was accomplished against the initial Sprint goals and planned tasks. This review is not merely a showcase of completed work but a dynamic forum where stakeholders can provide valuable input. This feedback can lead to necessary adjustments in the Product Backlog, ensuring that the project remains aligned with users’ expectations and evolving requirements. Following the Sprint Review, the team engages in a Sprint Retrospective. This meeting is dedicated to reflecting on the Sprint's processes and outcomes. The Retrospective provides an opportunity for the team to candidly discuss what went well, what did not go as planned, and what could be improved in future Sprints. The team identifies specific areas for improvement, such as workflow optimizations, communication enhancements, or technical practices that need refinement\cite{schwaber2020scrum}.\\

Within the context of our project, these meetings are essential for several reasons.

By demonstrating the functionality related to real-time communication, course management, and submission handling, we can obtain immediate feedback and make adjustments to the RTC API, signaling server, and other components as necessary.\\

The Sprint Retrospective, on the other hand, enables the team to reflect on the technical challenges encountered during the development of these features. For instance, we can discuss the integration of STUN for NAT traversal in our WebRTC implementation, the efficiency of our data flow for course and submission management, and any issues related to the entity-relationship mapping of our database. By evaluating these aspects, we can identify and implement changes that will enhance our development process, improve code quality, and ensure robust functionality in future Sprints. They ensure that the team remains responsive to user feedback, adapts to changes efficiently, and continuously seeks ways to enhance their effectiveness. These meetings contribute to the iterative and incremental development approach, which is crucial for delivering a high-quality e-learning platform that meets both current and future needs of users.
